# Bi-directional Bikol-English SMT Dataset

This repo serves as an open-source for a Bikol-English parallel corpus â€” a dataset used in our study titled "Bi-directional Bikol-English Statistical Machine Translator". 

## About the dataset
This dataset was scraped from the website [Bible.com](bible.com). Bible.com is a multilingual website that provides public access to different versions and languages of the Bible. This parallel corpus has already been cleaned and aligned properly by me and my colleagues. If you are interested to the process of preparing the dataset, kindly contact me to get a copy of the study.
